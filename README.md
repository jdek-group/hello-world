Hi all, for Project Documentation, we can consider the following (and change/adapt as needed)
 
1) Introduction (Overview, Problem Statement)

2) Data Sources (What is the data chosen, Data Dictionary)

3) Methodology/Approach (tech stack/tools, ETL (incl data preparation), architecture diagram, database schema/ERD diagram, table structure, data validation)

4) Challenges(Solutions/Workarounds)/Limitations

5) Findings/Analysis

6) Next Steps/Conclusion
 

The groups can decide to put them as word document or put the related contents in Jupyter Notebook, alongside with the code. 
 

Some project groups may have more than 1 Jupyter Notebooks (e.g 1 for ETL, 1 for analysis)
