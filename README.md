Hi all, for Project Documentation, we can consider the following (and change/adapt as needed)
 
1) Introduction (Overview, Problem Statement)

2) Data Sources (What is the data chosen, Data Dictionary)

3) Methodology/Approach (tech stack/tools, ETL (incl data preparation), architecture diagram, database schema/ERD diagram, table structure, data validation)

4) Challenges(Solutions/Workarounds)/Limitations
   <br>mmovie database is a huge amount of data (depending on period and user ratings)
   <br>download entire movie database requires few days (sometimes require recursive spam api calls to complete A-Z page of movies data)
   <br>free api is restrictive to 10,000 calls for example
   <br>workaround - movie dataset can be found and downloaded via kaggleapi
   

6) Findings/Analysis

7) Next Steps/Conclusion
 

The groups can decide to put them as word document or put the related contents in Jupyter Notebook, alongside with the code. 
 

Some project groups may have more than 1 Jupyter Notebooks (e.g 1 for ETL, 1 for analysis)
